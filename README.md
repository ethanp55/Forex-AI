# Forex-AI
I have seen/heard of different variants of DL systems for trading stocks and currencies.  This repo is a combination of different approaches to see if I can develop a model that is profitable in the Forex market.

UPDATE: I've had a hard time trying to stabilize the learning of the reinforcement learner, so I tried using an RNN instead.  It seems like I'm getting much better results, so I'm using that one with a practice account (see my other repo, called forex-rnn).
